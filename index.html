		<h1 id="about">About me</h1>
		<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the University of West Bohemia, Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Faculty
			of Mechanical Engineering. I'm originally an industrial engineer, but during my PhD studies, I've rediscovered my long
			forgotten passion for programming, thanks to my signature project - the Risk Environment Simulator.</p>
		<p>Programming in Unity3D became my hobby. I've been doing it for four years now and learned a lot about it. I attended two
			hackathons, where I made projects in Unity - 2016 Aimtechackathon in Pilsen, Czechia and 2017 Jamchester gaming jam in
			Manchester, UK. That's where I found out that I want to continue going down the path of 3D programming.</p>
		<p>I'm particularly interested in virtual reality and in it's serious purposes. If you ask me, I believe virtual reality is
			going to be a huge thing in medicine, education and design, but I'm quite sceptical about industrial applications - don't
			hesitate to write me, if you want to discuss it.</p>
		<p>My PhD studies have given me not only the skill to dig through scientific publication and to write them, it also gave me
			the ability to speak in front of people and to teach. These are soft skills I had been missing before and I'm thankful
			for my time spending here because of it.</p>
		<p>Sitting all day long in front of computer is, unforunately, a common thing among IT people. That's the same for me, as
			well as sitting in the car for the rest of the day. This is why I compensate it for my body by eating well and doing sports:
			mainly long distance running, hiking, bouldering and cycling.</p>

		<h1 id="projects">My Projects</h1>
		<p>Here you can read about some of the projects I've been or I was working on:</p>

		<h2>Risk Environment Simulator</h2>
		<p>As I've written before, this is my signature project and favourite, although it's a tough free-time garage work. It is
			a support for alcohol addiction treatment. The addicts are being treated in a safe and closed environment of the clinic,
			where they can use this simulator for training of their behaviour in risky situations, which is exposure to alcoholic
			beverages. Technically a 3D computer game taking place in a pub has an unbelievably strong effect on people who are addicted
			to alcohol.</p>
		<p>Alcohol addiction is a big problem not only in Czech Republic, but in a lot of countries across the world as well. Although
			I'm an engineer, I've been learning a lot about these problems and since I've seen an addict using the simluator for the
			first time, I believe this project has a great potential. Now, the psychiatry part of our team is designing clinical studies
			to evaluate the effects.</p>
		<p>The project has received medial attention. Here are some links (sorry, only Czech or German):</p>

		<h2>Virtual Assembly Manual</h2>
		<p>This is my topic for dissertation. Finding out how to quickly and correctly design and implement animated assemlby instructions.
			These animated instructions are made using my own Unity3D editor extensions that are designed to simply define the positions
			and movements. I evaluate the effectivity of common paper manuals vs these animated ones. Using Unity3D for it has the
			advantage of implementing modern technologies, like AR - see the video:

		<h2>CloudSlicer</h2>
		<p>When I was working at the Regional Technological Institute, I had access to a Leica ScanStation C5 3D scanner and needed
			to find a fast and simple way to convert the huge point clouds it created into something usable for further industrial
			engineering purposes. CloudSlicer is a fast tool written in C++ that allows you to quickly slice the point cloud and project
			these slices to bitmap images. These can be then used as underlay for layout modelling, discrete event simulations, ergonomy
			analyses etc. The problem with 3D scanning for these purposes is that the industry leading tools are not able to either
			import the point clouds at all or they become too laggy to work with them. On the other hand, all of these tools can import
			a bitmap image as an underlay. CloudSlicer includes a point cloud viewer made in Unity3D:</p>

		<h2>Layout Maker</h2>
		<p>LayoutMaker was my project I crashed into the wall with, although starting a big project without experience gave me many.
			The problem is that this project was too huge for one person and I didn't have any teammates to help me with it. This
			was a tool in Unity3D intended for 3D layout modelling. I finished the GUI and scene serialization for saving and loading,
			some 3D models import as well. With so much work left, I decided to leave the project as it would take decades to finish
			(something you find out too late if you don't have the experience). Still, I'm glad that I could learn a lot about software
			projects.

		<h2>Stranded Party</h2>
		<p>This is a project I'm particularly proud of. A game created at the Manchester gaming jam - the Jamchester 2017. A real
			time survival strategy where you got shipwrecked on an unknown planet. We were working on it for the whole weekend, with
			me almost non-stop programming and consuming about ten big cups of espresso (man, they've got good coffee in The Studio
			in Manchester).
			<a href="https://thyae.artstation.com/">Francisco Champac</a> made the artwork and 2D graphics, while Jakub Kopecký created the 3D models. Štefan Kecskés was
			programming with me. We laso got an official video from the early stage, where we don't still resemble zombies:</p>
