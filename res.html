        <p>Risk Environment Simulator is an ambitous project for providing support for alcohol addiction treatment. It is a
            free time garage job by us, enthusiasts into game development and full time psychiatrists. The main goal for
            the end users - the alcohol addicsts in an isolated clinical environment - is to spend an amount of time in a
            virtual pub. This invokes craving for alcohol in them. They usually do not realize what risk is exposure to a
            bottle of vodka or a glass of beer for them.</p>
        <p>Virtual reality has been used in medicine for various treatment support. It can help burn victims to lower their
            pain levels. It helps quadruplegics' nervous systems to regenerate faster. In psychiatry, it is used for phobia
            treatment, like arachnophobia or sociophobia. Virtually presented causes of phobias are working, but the subjects
            know nothing can happen to them. As for addictions - craving for the drug occurs after virtual exposition. Can
            it help? Now, we do not know, but the answer is our goal.</p>
